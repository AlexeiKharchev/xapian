This branch contains a quick hack which may help you rescue notmuch tags from a
broken database.

To build:

./bootstrap xapian-core
./configure
make

To use (assuming your mail is in ~/Mail):

xapian-core/bin/xapian-check ~/Mail/.notmuch/xapian 2> tmp.dump

Then check tmp.dump looks plausible, reindex your email, and:

notmuch restore < tmp.dump

Probably wise to keep the old database around until you've checked this worked.
